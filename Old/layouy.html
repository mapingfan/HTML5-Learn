    <p id="first">Icons may also be cast in metal, carved in stone, embroidered on cloth, painted on wood,
        done in mosaic or fresco work,
        printed on paper or metal, etc.
        Icons are often illuminated with a candle or jar of oil with a wick.
        (Beeswax for candles and olive oil for oil lamps are preferred because they burn very cleanly,
        although other materials are sometimes used.)
        The illumination of religious images with lamps or candles is an ancient practice pre-dating Christianity.

    <p id="second">
        Eastern Orthodoxy has no Papacy or
        similar authority, but instead teaches that all bishops are equal by virtue of their ordination, and each autocephalous church is typically governed by a Holy Synod. This is one of the main reasons for the division between the Roman Catholic
        Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.
    </p>
    <p id="third">
        United in communion with the Latin Church before the Eastâ€“West Schism in 1054, and with the Oriental churches for the first quarter of its history, Eastern Orthodoxy spread throughout the Roman and later Byzantine Empires and beyond,[8] playing a prominent role in European, Near Eastern, Slavic,
        and some African cultures. Its most prominent episcopal see is Constantinople.
